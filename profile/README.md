# Mini Framework

A simple, server-side, function-forward framework for building hypermedia apps quickly with HTMX.

Trying to provide framework DX ergonomics without framework bloat.

## No Build Step

Write TypeScript, start Bun, and serve your application. MiniFW runs directly on the server, so pages, partials, styles, and routes stay close to the code that defines them without a separate application build step.

## Super Fast

MiniFW renders HTML on the server. The initial response is usable HTML, and HTMX requests return only the fragment required for the next interaction. Your application state and rendering work remain on the server.

## Tiny Client Payloads

The browser receives rendered markup rather than a client-side application bundle. MiniFW adds only the small runtime needed to support HTMX navigation and promote scoped styles after swaps; generated HTML, CSS, and scripts are minified before they are sent.

## Scoped-Styles

Give a page or partial its own style function and MiniFW scopes those selectors to that component's markup automatically. Scoped styles are moved into the document head for full-page responses and after HTMX swaps, keeping component styles isolated without giving up server-rendered HTML.
